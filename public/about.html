      <h2 class="section-title">About Madrasat-ul-Bayt Institute</h2>
      <p>
        In August 2013, recognizing the responsibility of raising upright and grounded children in Islam, two pioneering families took the bold step of educating their children from primary to secondary level at home. The initiative quickly gained interest, and two more families joined this journey. From these humble beginnings within family homes, the name "Madrasat-ul-Bayt" — meaning "Home School" — was born. By the grace of Allah, the institution officially registered in August 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alhamdulillaah, the institute has consistently seen remarkable results, both in the academic performance and moral (Akhlaaq) development of its students. With a balanced approach to both Islamic and secular education, MBI aims to develop well-rounded individuals with strong character and faith.
